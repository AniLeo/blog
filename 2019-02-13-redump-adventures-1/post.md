# Redump Adventures 1: Getting Started
---
On my short college vacations, I decided to try learn something new. I asked myself, why not contribute to Redump? I decided to join Redump mostly to contribute towards the PS3 Game Library with whatever was missing that I could possibly own.
<br>
<br>
Upon joining, I was asked some questions regarding PS1, PS2 and PSP Portugal games, because several of those were still missing from the database. Although I was not really interested on these, I can dump PS2 and PSP games, so I decided I'd also take a look at PS2 and PSP stuff, but not PS1 stuff.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the PS1 market for games is very small in Portugal, I never owned a PS1 and I have no Plextor drive to dump PS1 CDs, so I ignored PS1 (which by the way has only a couple of known missing games and none are from Portugal, even though there may still be undiscovered stuff in Portugal) and focused on PS3, PS2 and PSP.
<br>
<br>
Surprisingly, while the PAL missing games list is quite small for PS2 and PSP, there were a lot of missing games from Portugal that are really trivial to obtain. I decided to try something: I was going to dump as many games as possible without spending a single cent, since I'm a student and don't really have money to spend on random games I won't have a use for afterwards.
<br>
<br>
For that purpose, I remembered a friend and other clients talking on CeX on how several people were buying, quickly playing throughout a whole game and returning it within the 48-hour satisfaction period to then get another game and do the same thing. I thought I could do the same thing, but instead of it being sake of playing these games myself, I'd do it just for documentating them, as most games I would buy on the upcoming days didn't interest me even in the slightest. I visited 3 CeX stores in my region throughout this period of time. For the sake of simplicity, I'll refer to those as CeX A, CeX B and CeX C.
<br>
<br>
I'm happy to say that in the 8 days that followed, I managed to find and dump:
- 5 PS3 Missing Games
- 5 PS2 Missing Games
- **2 PS2 Undiscovered Games**
- 4 PSP Missing Games
- 3 PS2 Verifications (for games with only a single dump on database)
- And a couple of verifications for games with 2+ dumps


## Day 1
I started off on CeX A by checking missing PS3 games list.

**Found (Missing List):**
Console | Region | ID | Name | Price
------- | ------ | -- | ---- | -----
PS3 | France | BLES-00154 | Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare | 6.00€

Bought that one since it was a French copy and not that common to find here, returned home and learned how to do a PS3 dump per Redump standards using my copy of Guitar Hero 3 as an example and comparing checksums and disc information with the existing data. It matched, so I then proceeded to dump the copy of CoD4:MW I got from CeX and submit it to Redump.


## Day 2
Visited CeX B next. First time going to that one, didn't find its location immediately. Checked missing PS3 games list again.

**Found (Missing List):**
Console | Region | ID | Name | Price
------- | ------ | -- | ---- | -----
PS3 | Europe | BLES-01068 | DanceDanceRevolution: New Moves | 6.00€

Same price! I just returned the game I've bought on the previous day and grabbed that one. Went home, dumped it and submitted to Redump.


## Day 3
Visited CeX A again. Once more, checking missing PS3 games list.

**Found (Missing List):**
Console | Region | ID | Name | Price
------- | ------ | -- | ---- | -----
PS3 | Europe | BLES-00772 | Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard | 6.00€
PS3 | Europe | BCES-01422/E/GER | LittleBigPlanet Karting | 12.00€

Returned the previous game and grabbed Arthur, then bought LBP Karting. Went home, dumped and submitted to Redump.


## Day 4
Visited CeX A again. This time, I decided to check both the missing PS3 and PS2 game lists, since it had some low hanging fruits as well, and since they seemed easy to dump.

**Found (Missing List):**
Console | Region | ID | Name | Price
------- | ------ | -- | ---- | -----
PS3 | Europe | BLES-01857 | Destiny | 6.00€
PS3 | Portugal | BCES-00871 | SingStar Portugal Hits | 10.00€
PS2 | Portugal | SLES-51219 | Harry Potter e a Câmara dos Segredos | 4.00€

Was looking for a possible version of Destiny that had a version newer than v1.00 on disc, which is the "Pre-Release Beta", but had no luck. I think all copies of Destiny shipped with v1.00 and then just installed updates normally on install. I returned the previous games (18€) and bought these. At this point, I had 20€ circulating in "CeX money", which I decided was as far as I was willing to put into CeX for now. Learned how to do a PS2 CD Redump quality dump, starting well with PS2 since CD is more complicated to dump than a PS2 DVD game. Was able to dump it properly with the help of other contributors.


## Day 5
Tried to visit CeX A, but it was closed for maintenance. Visited CeX B instead. This time, I decided to check for PS3, PS2 and PSP game lists, since I have a PSP with CFW and can dump PSP games.

**Found (Missing List):**
Console | Region | ID | Name | Price
------- | ------ | -- | ---- | -----
PS2 | Portugal | SLES-55619 | SingStar Portugal Hits | 5.00€
PS2 | Portugal | SLES-53242 | Madagascar | 2.50€
PSP | Portugal | UCES-01207 | Buzz!: Quem é o Génio Português? | 2.50€
PSP | Portugal | ULES-01550 | FIFA 12 | 2.50€
PSP | Portugal | ULES-01331 | FIFA 10 | 0.75€

Learned how to do a PSP Redump quality dump. Learned how to do a PS2 DVD Redump quality dump through DiscImageCreator. Dumped all of these, submitted to Redump. While dumping the PSP games, I stumbled upon a wiki forum submission template inaccuracy, which was promptly fixed by a member of Staff.


## Day 6
Visited CeX A. Pretty calm day, decided to just grab a missing PS3 title that was 15€ and keep the remaining on store credit.

**Found (Missing List):**
Console | Region | ID | Name | Price
------- | ------ | -- | ---- | -----
PS3 | Portugal | BCES-00459/POR | Buzz!: Quem e o Génio Português? | 15.00€


## Day 7
Visited CeX A again. Checking for PS3, PS2 and PSP. This time, I remembered someone I talked to over at Redump mentioning that the Portuguese region was hard to document for foreigners since the information available online was scarce, they had no one from Portugal actively working on it, and that there could be missing games that are unknown to even be missing from the missing games list.
<br>
<br>
I went over to the PS2 section and starting looking at every localized game (Portuguese title on cover) or games that seemed uncommon, and sure enough.. I stumbled upon a game that wasn't neither on Redump nor on the Missing Games list! Mundial 2002 Challenge, a Portugal region exclusive game. It's a soccer game showcasing the national team, based on "Sven-Göran Eriksson's World Challenge", "WM Nationalspieler" and "Marcel Desailly Pro Football". I immediately confirmed with other contributors the game was indeed missing and kept looking for more.
<br>
<br>
After a few minutes, I found yet another PS2 game that wasn't on the Missing List! The product code for this one yielded no results on Google at all, while the previous one did indicate the game it belonged to. This one was Bob the Constructor: Festival of Fun's Portugal release. Apparently other contributors had some trouble finding the PS1 and PS2 copies of this game for their regions, so apparently I was lucky finding it without specifically looking for it.
<br>
<br>
I checked all of the remaining PS2 stock of the store, as well as some PSP games, but I found no more games that weren't even listed as missing. The Redump Staff immediately added my findings to the wiki while I was still in store, with a note mentioning that I had acquired both titles.

**Found (Missing List):**
Console | Region | ID | Name | Price
------- | ------ | -- | ---- | -----
PS2 | Portugal | SCES-54263 | Buzz! O Quiz Desportivo | 4.00€
PSP | Portugal | ULES-01592 | FIFA 14 | 8.00€

**Found (Undiscovered):**
Console | Region | ID | Name | Price
------- | ------ | -- | ---- | -----
PS2 | Portugal | SLES-50855 | Mundial 2002 Challenge | 1.50€
PS2 | Portugal | SLES-55166 | Bob o Construtor: Festival do Divertimento | 1.00€

**Found (MIA, missing Verification Dump):**
Console | Region | ID | Name | Price
------- | ------ | -- | ---- | -----
PS2 | Portugal | SCES-54769 | SingStar Latino | 3.50€


## Day 8
Visited CeX C. Wanted to check their stock, but was disappointed. Returned previous games and bought a copy of GTA V with the barcode for the 2009 Rerelease, but unfortunately CeX had all discs swapped and I couldn't discern if they even had the correct one to begin with, because they didn't even have any disc for the box with the barcode I was looking for. No luck there, it was the normal v2.03 of the game already dumped many times.
<br>
<br>
I looked at my PS2 games at home, and found a copy of Original Edition Nemo that only had a single dump and it was the Platinum version, so did a verification dump of that one. I also did a Verification Dump of Chessmaster, since it only had one dump.

**Found (Missing List):**
Console | Region | ID | Name | Price
------- | ------ | -- | ---- | -----
PS2 | Portugal | SCES-54504 | Buzz!: O Mega Quiz | 12.00€

**Found (Verification Dump):**
Console | Region | ID | Name | Price
------- | ------ | -- | ---- | -----
PS2 | Portugal | SLES-51061# | Grand Theft Auto: Vice City | 6.00€


## Day 9
Visited CeX A. Was going to grab a PS3 SingStar that costed 20€, but I got warned by the current employee that I was doing too many refunds and that the system would eventually block me from refunding stuff, so I decided to not grab the SingStar game and stop the refund cycles for now, and got my 20€ back in store credit.
<br>
<br>
As I was about to leave with my 20€ store credit, I noticed they had put a copy of Demon's Souls: Black Phantom Edition for PS3 on sale for 15€ whereas it normally costs 50€ on their website and the regular edition 15€. Very weird. I asked to see the discs and the artbook, the copy was impeccable. I asked if 15€ was the price, they said yes, so I grabbed that heavily discounted Black Phantom Edition and kept 5€ as store credit.
<br>
